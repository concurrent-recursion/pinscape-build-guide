= Tables with MagnaSave Buttons

Most virtual cab builders include a second set of flipper buttons, located just behind (or sometimes below) the regular flipper buttons. Virtual pinball people usually call these the "MagnaSave" buttons, named after the trademarked ball-save feature that Williams used in a series of machines in the 1980s. The extra buttons on those machines activated magnets under the playfield that could catch the ball when it was about to enter one of the side drains.

Examples of extra flipper-type button positioning on real tables. Clockwise from top right: *Black Knight* (Williams, 1981), *Special Force* (Bally, 1986), *Nip It* (Bally, 1972), *Jolly Park* (Spinball, 1996). The in-line horizontal placement used in *Black Knight* is the most common, and most people think of it as the standard because Williams used it on all of their later machines, but some people find the extra buttons easier to reach with the vertical or diagonal arrangements. Note that all of the machines pictured here use the older, wider style of side rails that required cut-outs for the flipper buttons. The newer WPC-style side rails are much narrower and don't overlap the flipper button area, so you won't have to cut any holes if you're using modern parts to build your cab.

When I was building my cab, I was torn between, on the one hand, wanting to include the extra buttons for the sake of playability for those tables that need them, and on the other hand, wanting a more authentic look to the machine. The extra buttons aren't at all common on the real machines built in the 1990s, or indeed those built in any era, so I was leery about the aesthetic impact of including them. Some virtual cabs I've seen go so overboard with extra buttons that they look more like video games or slot machines than pinballs, and I didn't want to go too far down that road.

To help decide, I figured I should get a better idea of how many games would actually be affected if I didn't include the buttons. I knew there were a few MagnaSave titles from the 1980s, but I didn't know the exact number, and I didn't know if there were any other machines over the years that had similar buttons for other features. So I started digging through link:https://www.ipdb.org/[IPDB] and asking around on the forums.

The results surprised me. A little IPDB research reveals that the actual MagnaSave games amount to a rather modest seven titles. That much was in line with my expectations. What I didn't realize was how many other games were out there with other extra-button features besides MagnaSave. It turns out that dozens of real machines over several decades had extra flipper-like buttons. We really should stop calling them MagnaSave buttons, since the actual MagnaSave machines are only a small minority of games with similar buttons. But I have to admit that I don't have any better ideas for a name; "extra side buttons" just isn't as catchy.

The other thing I learned was that a rather large number of Visual Pinball tables rely on the nominal MagnaSave buttons to substitute for other, unusual types of special controls that were used in the original tables they're re-creating. I didn't realize before how many pinball machines have their own unique extra controls. This really shouldn't have surprised me, since pinball designers always want to make their games stand out from the crowd, and novel interactive controls are a good way to do that. But if the whole point of these extra controls is to be unique, they present a problem to the virtual cab builder, which is that we can't possibly include physical replicas of all of the novel controls from hundreds of different machines in a single virtual cab. There's just not room. And so, Visual Pinball table authors have adopted the convention that the MagnaSave buttons should serve as stand-ins when a table has unique controls beyond the standard flipper, Start, and launch buttons. This is another point in favor of including MagnaSave buttons on your virtual cab.

The results of my survey are presented in the list below. In the course of compiling this, it became apparent that there are two separate categories of MagnaSave usage that are important to virtual pin cab people, so the list is divided accordingly:

*  *Originals* are tables where the original arcade version featured extra flipper buttons on the side of the cabinet. For these tables, the MagnaSave buttons on your virtual cab will serve as accurate replicas of the extra side buttons on the real arcade game, providing very much the same playing experience.
*  *Virtuals* are tables that didn't have MagnaSave-style buttons in the original arcade versions, but that do have some _other_ kind of extra controls - extra buttons located somewhere other than alongside the flipper buttons, or some entirely different kind of control, such as a lever or knob. Visual Pinball can't assume that you have anything like those other controls on your pin cab, but it does assume that you have MagnaSave buttons, so Visual Pinball table authors have adopted the custom of using the MagnaSave buttons as substitutes for special controls. That changes the playing experience, but it at least makes it possible to fully play the game.

For my own build, this list settled the question for me, easily in favor of including the extra buttons. As you can see, a lot of games take advantage of them. But there's no reason you have to come to the same conclusion; you might read through the list and conclude that you're just not interested in enough of the titles that use the extra buttons. That's why I thought it was useful to present a list of specific titles, to make it more concrete than just a vague claim that there are lots of such games.

== Notes on the special controls

*Stern-style lockbar button:* Many of the Stern titles from the mid "aughts" (around 2005) to present feature an extra button on the top of the lockbar that activates special features at certain points during the game. We usually call it the "Fire!" button because that's how it's labeled on several of the titles. It's so ubiquitous on newer Stern games that I think it's on the verge of joining the set of standard controls you expect to find on a virtual cab, but so far it's not common. For more, see the notes on the xref:cabButtons.adoc#fireButton[Fire! button] in xref:cabButtons.adoc[Cabinet Buttons] .

*"El Movimento":* A few games from Peyper (a Spanish manufacturer) had a feature known as "El Movimento", which used knobs next to the flipper buttons that moved the playfield. The VP re-creations of these tables approximate this by mapping the MagnaSave buttons to a special non-tilting nudge function.
