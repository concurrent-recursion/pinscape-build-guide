= KL25Z Hardware Setup

The KL25Z comes fully assembled and ready to use. All you have to do to get it working is plug it into your computer with a USB cable.

If you're going to connect any additional hardware to the KL25Z (plunger, buttons, feedback devices), there is one bit of additional hardware assembly you'll have to do. You'll need to install "pins" for plugging in connectors to the other devices. They don't install these at the factory; they just include empty solder pads where you can install your own pin headers if you wish to.

The KL25Z will run happily without the headers installed, so you don't have to do this right now. You can skip ahead to the xref:kl25zSoftwareSetup.adoc[software setup] , and come back here later, if you want to try out the board first.

The specific headers to buy (along with the mating connectors, known as "crimp pin housings") are listed in the "KL25Z Microcontroller (Standalone)" section in xref:partslist.adoc#standaloneBom[Electronic Parts List] . They look like this on their own:

The installation procedure is a little different depending on whether you're using the KL25Z "standalone" or with the Pinscape expansion boards. Continue to the appropriate section below.

== Standalone KL25Z pin headers

If you're using the KL25Z *without* the Pinscape expansion boards, the pin headers go on the top side of the KL25Z - the side with the large CPU chip and the USB connectors. Here's how they look when installed:

*Important!* Install the pins on the top as shown *only for standalone use* , not for the expansion boards. The expansion boards require the pins to be installed on the bottom side of the board instead.

The pin headers are pretty easy to install:

* Fit the headers onto the solder pads with the *shorter* pins facing the board
* Seat the plastic base flat against the surface of board
* Solder the pins on the bottom side of the board

Be sure to solder *all* of the pins. Some people ask if it's okay to just solder a couple of the pins, since that makes a strong enough mechanical connection. It's not; you really do have to solder all of them. The solder is there for the electrical connection between pins and pads, so each pin needs its own solder joint. See xref:pinHeaders.adoc[0.1" Pin Headers] for details.

The mating connectors in the parts list are "crimp pin housings". See xref:crimpPins.adoc[Crimp Pins] for help assembling them. These are ideal for wiring to the KL25Z because they make it easy to connect each pin individually to a separate piece of hookup wire. Each pin has its own unique function - some pins are for button inputs, some are for connecting a plunger sensor, some are for feedback outputs. The individual wiring per pin makes them take a little work to assemble, but it pays off in the long run because it lets you customize the wiring exactly to fit your cabinet.

=== Warning on KL25Z GPIO pins

Never connect any output devices directly to the KL25Z. The KL25Z GPIO pins have extremely low power handling limits:

* Maximum 3.3V
* Maximum 4mA

Exceeding these limits can destroy the entire KL25Z, because the GPIO pins are wired directly into CPU core. Applying higher voltage or current levels can overheat the CPU chip and destroy the whole thing.

You _can_ directly wire button inputs to the KL25Z, as long as you follow our wiring plans in xref:buttons.adoc[Pinscape Button Inputs] . You can also connect any of the plunger sensor designed described in this guide, as long as you follow our wiring plans.

The main thing that you should never connect directly is any sort of feedback device - flasher LEDs, LED light strips, strobes, button lamps, motors, solenoids, contactors, relays, etc. You always need some sort of "booster" circuit with feedback devices. We provide several options in xref:psOutputsStandalone.adoc[Pinscape Outputs Setup (Standalone KL25Z)] .

=== How to approach wiring with the standalone KL25Z

You'll notice that the pins on the KL25Z are arranged into four groups, for four separate connectors, so you might think it would be nice to use these to group pins by function: one connector might have all of the button inputs, say, and another might have all of the feedback outputs. Believe me, that occurred to me as well. Unfortunately, it really can't be done. The problem is that each pin on the KL25Z has its own special-purpose capabilities, which means that we can only use certain pins for certain functions. And these capabilities aren't grouped very neatly in the KL25Z pin layout. That's not something we can change through software, since a lot of this is baked into the circuit design inside the KL25Z CPU. So the Pinscape functions have to be scattered among the headers.

That's where the crimp pin headers are handy. They let you connect each pin to its own hookup wire, so it doesn't really matter that the functions aren't grouped.

Here's how I'd approach the KL25Z wiring:

* Don't worry about pre-assembling any of the housings. You can leave any or all of the pin slots empty in a housing, and you can insert one crimp pin at a time, so you can fill in the pin slots as you need them. Start with all of the connectors empty. When you install a button in your cab, add the wiring for the button with a hookup wire leading back to the KL25Z, crimp a pin on the end of the wire, and insert it in the housing in the appropriate slot.
* Treat the wires as permanently installed in the cabinet, but treat the things connected to the wire as removable, so use pluggable connectors at the ends of a wire. For the KL25Z, the crimp pin connectors serve. At the other end:
** For buttons, use "quick connect" push-on terminals, if possible. The SuzoHapp buttons use 1/4" (6.35mm) quick-connect terminals, compatible with 1/4" female spade connectors.
** For connections to other circuit board (such as a MOSFET booster for feedback outputs), use another similar pin header and crimp pin wire housing on that end.
** For a plunger sensor, I recommend building a xref:plungerBreakout.adoc[plunger sensor breakout board] . That will give you an easy way to plug in any of our plunger sensor types using the standard plugs used on the expansion board. You can alternatively hard-wire the sensor to the KL25Z headers, but that breaks my rule about making everything easily unpluggable, and it'll make things harder if you ever need to remove the sensor for any reason.

== KL25Z pin headers for the expansion boards

For use with the Pinscape expansion boards, the pin headers go on the *bottom* side of the KL25Z. The bottom is the side with the rubber feet, and *without* any chips. The chips and USB connectors are all on the top side.

To install the pin headers:

* Fit them onto the solder pads with the *shorter* pins facing the board
* seat the plastic base flat against the surface of board
* and solder the pins on the opposite side of the board (in this case, since we're installing the pins on the bottom side, the solder goes on the top side)

See xref:pinHeaders.adoc[0.1" Pin Headers] for more about the pin headers in general.
